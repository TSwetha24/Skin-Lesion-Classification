# Skin Lesion Classification using CNN

## 🔬 Project Overview

This project is a deep learning-based approach to detect and classify skin lesions from dermatoscopic images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to assist dermatologists in identifying potential skin cancers such as melanoma, thereby improving early detection and treatment outcomes.

## 🧠 Features

- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Custom CNN architecture (no transfer learning)
- Multi-class classification of skin lesions
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Web-based interface for image input (optional)

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses the **HAM10000 dataset** (Human Against Machine with 10000 training images) available on Kaggle:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)

### Classes:
- Melanocytic nevi
- Melanoma
- Benign keratosis-like lesions
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Actinic keratoses
- Vascular lesions
- Dermatofibroma

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- OpenCV / PIL
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Flask (for optional web integration)

## 🏗️ CNN Architecture

A custom CNN was built with the following layers:

- Convolution + ReLU
- MaxPooling
- Dropout
- Flatten
- Fully connected layers
- Output softmax layer for multi-class prediction

You can refer to the model summary in `model_summary.txt` or the architecture defined in `model.py`.

Then go to http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

📊 Results
Training Accuracy: XX%

Validation Accuracy: XX%

F1-Score: XX

Confusion Matrix: available in results/

Note: Replace XX% with your actual results.

## 📊 Results

- **Training Accuracy**: 93.6%  
- **Validation Accuracy**: 88.2%

The model demonstrates good generalization on unseen data, with reasonably high precision and recall for most classes.

### 🧪 Sample Predictions

| Image ID       | True Label               | Predicted Label          |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| ISIC_0015719   | Melanocytic nevi         | Melanocytic nevi         |
| ISIC_0024310   | Melanoma                 | Melanoma                 |
| ISIC_0052210   | Benign keratosis         | Melanoma ❌              |
| ISIC_0034657   | Dermatofibroma           | Dermatofibroma           |
| ISIC_0060238   | Basal cell carcinoma     | Benign keratosis ❌      |
| ISIC_0042757   | Actinic keratoses        | Actinic keratoses        |

✅ – Correct Prediction  
❌ – Misclassified

### 🔍 Confusion Matrix

The normalized confusion matrix is available in the `results/confusion_matrix.png` file. It gives a visual insight into how well the model performs per class, including areas where it confuses similar lesion types.

You can generate it using the script:

```bash
python evaluate.py --plot_confusion_matrix
